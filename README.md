# American Sign Language Detection using Deep Neural Networks
American Sign Language (ASL) is a visual language. With signing, the brain processes linguistic information through the eyes. The shape, placement, and movement of the hands, as well as facial expressions and body movements, all play important parts in conveying information. It is the primary language of many North Americans who are deaf and hard of hearing, and is used by many hearing people as well. The project can be used by dumb people to easily communicate with people who doesn't understand sign language.

## Formation of message using finger spelling in ASL

Fingerspelling is part of ASL and is used to spell out English words. In the fingerspelled alphabet, each letter corresponds to a distinct handshape. Fingerspelling is often used for proper names or to indicate the English word for something. We are using **Convolutional Neural Networks** to predict the sign language letter and combine those predicted letters to form the sentence to be conveyed.
The message will then be converted from text to speech using Python's built-in support.
The input will be provided in real time using the webcam.
